Created a website that was not yet designed (isaiah approved it) for a clothing store and added pages with different clothing items and a page for a contact and a page for learning more about the certain vendors.  After Juan's peer review, we fixed the footer on the meet our team page by taking away the padding.  The nav was intentional like that and we made sure mobile was as near perfect to the figma.

"looks nice, the main page is kinda misleading and makes me think that the slogna are actually buttons but it seems to work just fine, all of the shop pages are also fine and responsive, my only real critics is that on the vendors it would be nice if it opened 
a new tab instead of just loading it as is, also, on the phone responsiveness on the meet our team page the padding on the "save the planet" col is adding extra space that makes it look weird, also the dropdown on the nav bar pushes it up for some reason no idea if 
thats intentional"
