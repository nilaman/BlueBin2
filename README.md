"looks nice, the main page is kinda misleading and makes me think that the slogna are actually buttons but it seems to work just fine, all of the shop pages are also fine and responsive, my only real critics is that on the vendors it would be nice if it opened 
a new tab instead of just loading it as is, also, on the phone responsiveness on the meet our team page the padding on the "save the planet" col is adding extra space that makes it look weird, also the dropdown on the nav bar pushes it up for some reason no idea if 
thats intentional"
